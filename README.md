Battleship Game with Graphical User Interface (GUI) using MATLAB

I hope you enjoy playing my battleship game 
This game is developed with GUI, therefore, the user will be able to see everything for example where they are placing ships, where they are attacking or getting hit, and the results message. 

It is a turn-based battleship game where a player plays against a computer, and each gets a chance to attack the other. Each player and enemy get 10 chances to attack.

Initially, the grid for the enemy(computer) and the user is blue.

My game will allow you to select 10 grid positions to place your battleships on a 10x10 grid. The selected grid to place the battleships will become grey. Then you will select a grid position on the enemyâ€™s(computer) side to attack. The computer will randomly and anonymously place its 10 ships without changing colour on the grid and randomly select a position to attack when its computer turns to attack.

If an enemy or user hits a grid or gets hit with a battleship on it, then that grid will become red and if it is a miss, it will become yellow.

At the end of the game when the player and computer have both attacked 10 times. Depending on who hit the greatest number of battleships of opponents the winner is decided, sometimes it can be a tie.

Developed incrementally and unit-tested to ensure the program does not crash on invalid input.

Developed in a way that the enemy does not produce overlapping ships on its grid and does not attack the same grid position of the user when randomly selecting these two things.
